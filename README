Compile the program (with Makefile for example).

Makefile usage:
1) make sure g++-6
2) in dir of the project execute: `make`
3) use `make clean` or `make distclean` to remove all .o and main files.

To run: `./main name_of_stl_file.stl $(some numbers)`
Here $(some numbers) stands for some Points in 3D space (3 numbers for each point). At least 6 numbers required (2 points -- start, end).
You can also type in more end points.
