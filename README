Compile the program (with Makefile for example).
Also tested to build without errors in MVS 2017.

Makefile usage:
1) make sure g++-6
2) in dir of the project execute: `make`
3) use `make clean` or `make distclean` to remove all .o and main files.

To run: `./main name_of_stl_file.stl`

The best way to add more points to check the distance:
	`V_end.push_back((std::next(std::begin(graph), $(SOME_NUMBER)))->first);`
Just look at main:56:5
