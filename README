Compile the program (with Makefile for example).
Also tested to build without errors in MVS 2017.

Makefile usage:
1) make sure g++-6
2) in dir of the project execute: `make`
3) use `make clean` or `make distclean` to remove all .o and main files.

To run: `./main name_of_stl_file.stl $(some numbers)`
Here $(some numbers) stands for some Points in 3D space (3 numbers for each point). At least 6 numbers required (2 points -- start, end).
You can also type in more end points.

For example the following run statement should work fine:
`./main ./examples/testcube_20mm.stl 10 10 10 -10 -10 -10 10 -10 -10`
								    |start po| |first end| |second end point|
